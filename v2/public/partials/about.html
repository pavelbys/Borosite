        Boron nitride nanotubes are a revolutionary material with unique multifunctional properties and
        great commercial potential. BNNTs have a structure similar to their well-known carbon nanotube (CNT)
        counterparts, but with alternating boron and nitrogen atoms self-assembling into a nanoscale tube whose
        diameter may range from 1 to 20nm and whose length may vary from 50 to 1000 microns. Due to their similar
        structure, BNNTs have the same phenomenal mechanical properties associated with CNTs, particularly their
        incredible mechanical strength and ability to be integrated into almost any shape.  However, BNNTs offer
        additional, superior properties and characteristics when compared with CNTs, most notably:
