     <h1> Aerospace Applications</h1>
     An almost endless list of potential applications exist for BNNT yarn and tape reinforcement based on their unique mechanical, electro-mechanical, thermal, shielding, and high fracture energy properties. They are ideally suited towards applications in extreme environments such as space, where their very low density provides an additional advantage.

     <h1> Terrestrial Applications </h1>
     BNNTs are also ideal replacements for materials used in many terrestrial technologies. Potential applications include: structural health monitoring, structural reinforcement, structural composites, shielding, ballistic protection, thermal management, radiation protection, actuation, and multifunctional combinations of the above. Furthermore, if non-toxicity is confirmed in-vivo, this would lead to a host of biomedical and environmental applications as well.

     <h1> Solar Cells </h1>
     Because the band gap in boron nitride can be tailored with composition due to high electron mobility and optical transparency, it is possible to make BNNT single and multijunction solar cells from this material.  The system consists of: thin nanotube sheets (which can be woven, non-woven, aligned or non-aligned) composed of boron nitride, boron-nitrogen-carbon and nearly pure carbon nanotubes of small diameter. The p-junction generally consists of a boron-nitride doped carbon-nanotube material or a carbon doped boron-nitride nanotube material, together with an n-junction of a carbon nanotube material. Alternatively doped thin-film boron nitride or graphene thin films can be employed along with alternative n-junction materials. Multi-junction solar cells of potentially higher efficiency can also be made of similar doped nanotube materials or thin films, sufficiently flexible to bend nearly 180 degrees, and capable of operating at very high temperatures. Both the single junction cell and the multijunction cell have the potential to outperform todayâ€™s cells in terms of energy per unit weight.
