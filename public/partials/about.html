    <h1> The Company </h1>
        Boronite was incorporated in 2015 and has now started operating in Burlington, MA. The founders are: David Lashmore, Ph.D. (CEO), Pavel Bystricky, Ph.D. (CTO) and Ivka Kalus, MBA (CFO). Our patent-pending technology is now being significantly developed to meet a specific application for very lightweight cables.

    <h1> The Material </h1>
        Boron nitride nanotubes are a revolutionary material with unique multifunctional properties and
        great commercial potential. Their electro-mechanical, thermal, shielding, and high fracture energy properties have the potential to revolutionize many aerospace and terrestrial applications. By significantly reducing weight, improving strength, and replacing multiple materials in each application, Boronite’s materials will have a major positive impact on efficiency and emissions.

        BNNTs have a structure similar to their well-known carbon nanotube (CNT)
        counterparts, but with alternating boron and nitrogen atoms self-assembling into a nanoscale tube whose
        diameter may range from 1 to 20nm and whose length may vary from a few microns to millimeters. Due to their similar
        structure, BNNTs have the same phenomenal mechanical properties associated with CNTs, particularly their
        incredible mechanical strength and ability to be integrated into almost any shape.  However, BNNTs offer
        additional, superior properties and characteristics when compared with CNTs, most notably:
