     <strong> Cables </strong>
     <br>
     Boron Nitride Nanotubes (BNNT) in pure form have a very low dielectric constant of ~1.3. Using BNNT tape to replace Teflon in coaxial cables would have a profound influence on:
     (1) Cable weight - reduced by ~80%
     (2) High temperature resistance - improved because pure BNNT can be used up to 900° C in air
     (3) Flexibility, with a sub-mm bending radius - this would dramatically improve cable routing and packaging
     (4) Cable abrasion resistance would improve.

     <strong> Solar Cells </strong>
     <br>
     Because the band gap in boron nitride can be tailored with composition due to high electron mobility and optical transparency, it is possible to make BNNT single and multijunction solar cells from this material.  The system consists of: thin nanotube sheets (which can be woven, non-woven, aligned or non-aligned) composed of boron nitride, boron-nitrogen-carbon and nearly pure carbon nanotubes of small diameter. The p-junction generally consists of a boron-nitride doped carbon-nanotube material or a carbon doped boron-nitride nanotube material, together with an n-junction of a carbon nanotube material. Alternatively doped thin-film boron nitride or graphene thin films can be employed along with alternative n-junction materials. Multi-junction solar cells of potentially higher efficiency also can be made of similar doped nanotube materials or thin films, sufficiently flexible to bend nearly 180 degrees, and capable of operating at very high temperatures. Both the single junction cell and the multijunction cell have the potential to outperform today’s cells in terms of energy per unity weight.
